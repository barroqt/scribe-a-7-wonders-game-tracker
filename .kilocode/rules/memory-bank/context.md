## Data Model

- **Player**: id, name (unique), createdAt
- **Game**: id, playedAt, createdAt
- **GameParticipant**: id, gameId (FK cascade), playerId (FK), wonder, score, rank

## Stats Calculation

Stats are computed on-the-fly from raw game data (no denormalized stats stored). Deletion of a game automatically recalculates all derived stats on next page load.

## Wonders

Alexandria, Babylon, Ephesus, Gizah, Halikarnassos, Olympia, Rhodos (7 total)
